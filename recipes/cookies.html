        <p>These <em>chewy gooey</em> cookies will be your go-to recipe 
        when you need to whip up a sweet treat for a get together or simply to 
        satisfy you own sweet tooth.</p>
                
        <p>Some cookie recipes will call for chilled batter but these are 
        good to go from the moment you mix. It is a simple recipe but does
        require some attention to detail when it comes to technique. 
        I will include these details throughout the method section to ensure that
        you are left with fault-free <em>chewy gooey</em> disks of delight.</p>

        <p><h2>Instructions:</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/170ºC Fan and Line 2 Large baking trays with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter slowly until it is fully melted, leave to cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, beat in both the light brown soft sugar and granulated sugar until they are all thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract and beat the mixture until the mixture becomes much lighter in colour, is smooth, and has increased in volume.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients (plain flour, bicarbonate of soda, and sea salt) and beat again until smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold through the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Using a 5cm Scoop, portion the cookies onto the trays (I did 6 per tray).</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies in the oven for 12-13 minutes for softer chewy cookies, OR 15 minutes for soft/crunchy cookies.</li>
            <li>Leave the cookies on the tray for 5 minutes after they have finished baking, and then transfer to a wire rack and continue to cool! Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
