        <p>These <em>chewy gooey</em> cookies will be your go-to recipe 
        when you need to whip up a sweet treat for a get together or simply to 
        satisfy you own sweet tooth.</p>
                
        <p>Some cookie recipes will call for chilled batter but these are 
        good to go from the moment you mix. It is a simple recipe but does
        require some attention to detail when it comes to technique. 
        I will include these details throughout the method section to ensure that
        you are left with fault-free <em>chewy gooey</em> disks of delight.</p>
